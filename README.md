Based on *'Section 12: A Look Behind the Scenes of React & Optimization Techniques'* of Academind's *'React - The Complete Guide'* course, this repo has commits of examples with explanations of:

* `React.memo` with primitive value props to only re-evaluate when those props change - [Commit link](https://github.com/jro31/react-memo-demo/commit/49c0321926798553ceffd9f04432f58ad0db5850)
* `useCallback()` used with `React.memo` with function props to avoid re-evaluating each time the parent component is re-evaluated - [Commit link](https://github.com/jro31/react-memo-demo/commit/d40aca7e8119d3f61b15ff5da8d58152694efa55)
* `useCallback()` when used with dependencies - [Commit link](https://github.com/jro31/react-memo-demo/commit/b5c53a3f3d881d6612fd16d62f7f4f7e6f6e5857)
* `useMemo()`, and how it's different to `useCallback()` - [Commit link](https://github.com/jro31/react-memo-demo/commit/b9eec322cff49d846e7e2e462fd394a7e3f5637a)
